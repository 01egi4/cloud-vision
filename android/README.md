# Cloud Vision Android Sample

So you want to use the Cloud Vision API from Android?
Then this sample is for you. It's a minimal single-activity
sample that shows you how to make a call to the Cloud Vision
API with an image picked from your device's gallery.

## Prerequisites
- An API key for the Cloud Vision API (See
  [the docs](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/getting-started) to learn more)
- An Android device running Android 5.0 or higher
- [Android Studio][android-studio], with a recent version of the Android SDK.

## Setup
**Note:** The Cloud Vision API uses a generated client library. It will be available
soon via Gradle, but until then we must build it from source, and copy it
into our project. So, thanks for your understanding as an early adopter.

-  Open `MainActivity` and replace `CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY` with your
   Cloud Vision api key.
- Build and run the app from Android Studio. Recognize stuff.
- Profit!
