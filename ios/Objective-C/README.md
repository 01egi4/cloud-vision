# Image detection with iOS Photos

**This is not an official Google product.**

This app demonstrates how to use the [Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) to run label and face detection on an image.

## Local Setup

In `ViewController.m`, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the service account key you generated for your Cloud project.

To run this app locally clone the repo and run the command:

`open imagepicker-objc.xcodeproj`

Then build and run the app.
